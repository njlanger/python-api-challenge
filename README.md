# python-api-challenge

The Jupyter Notebook cells with comments were provided as a starting point of reference. There was a fair amount of code provided, so I made a copy of the starter code notebooks and placed them in the ‘Starter’ code folder as a reference. 
The code for this assignment was written from what was covered in class. Using ChatGPT as a debugging source. 
The assignment was divided into two parts, WeatherPy and VacationPy. The code in VacationPy is depended upon the output from WeatherPy. 
API codes were required from https://openweathermap.org/, and https://www.geoapify.com/. There is a folder named ‘API_keys.py’ that house those codes. Individuals will need to provide a person API key for the code to function.
